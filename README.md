## Overview

Use data scraping and ML techniques to predict market movement and use financial analysis techniques to automate trading.

## Steps

1. Import libraries used for financial analysis (yahoo finance, pandas, etc.)
2. Be able to query based on ticker, or set of tickers and output dataframe of historical prices
3. From ticker historical data, be able to output select data, such as EMA, SMA, for time periods such as 20 day EMA, 100 day EMA
4. Graph averages
5. Figure out when 100 day MA = 20 day MA
6. Figure out how to have this running for live data, updates with new prices every X time interval (1min, 1hr, 1day, etc., or 1sec ongoing for day trading)
7. When equality is hit, send SMS with ticker info
